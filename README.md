# 📚 Nexus Checkout UI — Multi-Step Form Resource

A reusable **multi-step checkout UI resource** designed as a small front-end library for book stores or e-commerce projects.

This project focuses on creating a clean, accessible, and animated checkout experience using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — including stepper navigation, accordion panels, and form validation.

Built as a **design + development resource**, not a final product.

## 🌱 What I Learned

While building this resource, I improved my understanding of:

- Designing reusable UI components (stepper, accordion, forms)
- Creating scalable design systems using CSS variables
- Managing multi-step logic with vanilla JavaScript
- Handling client-side validation and error states
- Improving accessibility with labels, fieldsets, and ARIA
- Structuring complex forms with CSS Grid
- Writing cleaner UI logic without frameworks
- Building interactive UX patterns from scratch

It helped reinforce how UX, accessibility, and front-end logic work together when creating form-heavy interfaces.

## 📍 The Process

This project was created as a **UI pattern / library-style resource** for checkout flows.

Instead of relying on frameworks, I focused on building everything with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to strengthen my fundamentals.

The goal was to design a flexible checkout system that could be easily adapted to other projects:

- Stepper + accordion interaction
- Validation per step before progressing
- Visual feedback for errors and completion
- Clear hierarchy and spacing
- Soft animations to guide the user

The result is a modular checkout flow that can be reused or extended for different e-commerce contexts.
